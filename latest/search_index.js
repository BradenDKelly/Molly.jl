    "text": "(Image: Travis build status) (Image: AppVeyor build status) (Image: Coverage status) (Image: Latest release) (Image: License) (Image: Documentation stable) (Image: Documentation latest)Much of science can be explained by the movement and interaction of molecules. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational technique used to explore these phenomena, from noble gases to biological macromolecules. Molly.jl is a pure Julia package for MD, and for the simulation of physical systems more broadly.At the minute the package is a proof of concept for MD in Julia. It is not production ready. It can simulate a system of atoms with arbitrary interactions as defined by the user. Implemented features include:Interface to allow definition of new forces, simulators, thermostats, neighbour finders, loggers etc.\nRead in pre-computed Gromacs topology and coordinate files with the OPLS-AA forcefield and run MD on proteins with given parameters. In theory it can do this for any regular protein, but in practice this is untested.\nNon-bonded interactions - Lennard-Jones Van der Waals/repulsion force, electrostatic Coulomb potential, gravitational potential, soft sphere potential.\nBonded interactions - covalent bonds, bond angles, torsion angles.\nAndersen thermostat.\nVelocity Verlet and velocity-free Verlet integration.\nExplicit solvent.\nPeriodic boundary conditions in a cubic box.\nNeighbour list to speed up calculation of non-bonded forces.\nAutomatic multithreading.\nSome analysis functions, e.g. RDF.\nRun with Float64 or Float32.\nPhysical agent-based modelling.\nVisualise simulations as animations.\nDifferentiable molecular simulation on an experimental branch - see the relevant docs.Features not yet implemented include:Protein force fields other than OPLS-AA.\nWater models.\nEnergy minimisation.\nOther temperature or pressure coupling methods.\nCell-based neighbour list.\nProtein preparation - solvent box, add hydrogens etc.\nTrajectory/topology file format readers/writers.\nQuantum mechanical modelling.\nGPU compatibility.\nHigh test coverage."

There are further examples in the Molly examples section. For more information on specific types or functions, see the Molly API section or call ?function_name in Julia. The Differentiable simulation with Molly section describes taking gradients through simulations.Molly takes a modular approach to molecular simulation. To run a simulation you create a Simulation object and call simulate! on it. The different components of the simulation can be used as defined by the package, or you can define your own versions. An important principle of the package is that your custom components, particularly force functions, should be easy to define and just as performant as the built-in versions."

    "title": "Forces",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Forces define how different parts of the system interact. In Molly they are separated into two types. GeneralInteractions are present between all or most atoms, and account for example for non-bonded terms. SpecificInteractions are present between specific atoms, and account for example for bonded terms.The available general interactions are:LennardJones.\nSoftSphere.\nCoulomb.\nGravity.\nMie.The available specific interactions are:HarmonicBond.\nHarmonicAngle.\nTorsion.To define your own GeneralInteraction, first define the struct:struct MyGeneralInter <: GeneralInteraction\n    nl_only::Bool\n    # Any other properties, e.g. constants for the interaction\nendThe nl_only property is required and determines whether the neighbour list is used to omit distant atoms (true) or whether all atom pairs are always considered (false). Next, you need to define the force! function acting between a pair of atoms. For example:function Molly.force!(forces,\n                        inter::MyGeneralInter,\n                        s::Simulation,\n                        i::Integer,\n                        j::Integer)\n    dr = vector(s.coords[i], s.coords[j], s.box_size)\n\n    # Replace this with your force calculation\n    # A positive force causes the atoms to move apart\n    f = 0.0\n\n    fdr = f * normalize(dr)\n    forces[i] -= fdr\n    forces[j] += fdr\n    return nothing\nendIf you need to obtain the vector from atom i to atom j, use the vector function. This gets the vector between the closest images of atoms i and j accounting for the periodic boundary conditions. The Simulation is available so atom properties or velocities can be accessed, e.g. s.atoms[i].σ or s.velocities[i]. This form of the function can also be used to define three-atom interactions by looping a third variable k up to j in the force! function. Typically the force function is where most computation time is spent during the simulation, so consider optimising this function if you want high performance.To use your custom force, add it to the list of general interactions:general_inters = (MyGeneralInter(true),)Then create and run a Simulation as above. Note that you can also use named tuples instead of tuples if you want to access interactions by name:general_inters = (MyGeneralInter = MyGeneralInter(true),)For performance reasons it is best to avoid containers with abstract type parameters, such as Vector{GeneralInteraction}.To define your own SpecificInteraction, first define the struct:struct MySpecificInter <: SpecificInteraction\n    # Any number of atoms involved in the interaction\n    i::Int\n    j::Int\n    # Any other properties, e.g. a bond distance corresponding to the energy minimum\nendNext, you need to define the force! function. For example:function Molly.force!(forces, inter::MySpecificInter, s::Simulation)\n    dr = vector(s.coords[inter.i], s.coords[inter.j], s.box_size)\n\n    # Replace this with your force calculation\n    # A positive force causes the atoms to move apart\n    f = 0.0\n\n    fdr = f * normalize(dr)\n    forces[inter.i] += fdr\n    forces[inter.j] -= fdr\n    return nothing\nendThe example here is between two atoms but can be adapted for any number of atoms. To use your custom force, add it to the specific interaction lists:specific_inter_lists = ([MySpecificInter(1, 2), MySpecificInter(3, 4)],)"

    "text": "note: Note\nThis section can be read as a standalone introduction to differentiable simulation with Molly, but makes more sense in the context of the Molly documentation.In the last few years, the deep learning revolution has broadened to include the paradigm of differentiable programming. The concept of using automatic differentiation to obtain exact gradients through physical simulations has many interesting applications, including parameterising forcefields and training neural networks to describe atom potentials.There are some projects that explore differentiable molecular simulations, such as Jax, M.D. and DiffTaichi, or you can write your own algorithms in something like PyTorch. However Julia provides a strong suite of autodiff tools, with Zygote.jl allowing source-to-source transformations for much of the language. The differentiable branch of Molly lets you use the power of Zygote to obtain gradients through molecular simulations. It is not yet merged because it is experimental, untested, slow, liable to change, has a slightly different API to the main package, and only works for some parts of the main package.With those caveats in mind, it provides a neat way to run differentiable simulations using the same abstractions as the main package. In particular, you can define general and specific interactions, letting you move away from N-body simulations and describe molecular systems. This is possible with something like a PyTorch tensor, but the force functions quickly get complicated to write. It also lets you use neighbour lists and periodic boundary conditions, or add neural networks to your simulations."

    "text": "First, we show how taking gradients through a simulation can be used to optimise an atom property in a Lennard-Jones gas. In this type of simulation each atom has a σ value that determines how close it likes to get to other atoms. We are going to find the σ value that results in a desired distance of each atom to its closest neighbour. First we need a function to obtain the mean distance of each atom to its closest neighbour:using Molly\n\nfunction meanminseparation(final_coords, box_size)\n    n_atoms = length(final_coords)\n    sum_dists = 0.0\n    for i in 1:n_atoms\n        min_dist = 100.0\n        for j in 1:n_atoms\n            i == j && continue\n            dist = sqrt(sum(abs2, vector(final_coords[i], final_coords[j], box_size)))\n            min_dist = min(dist, min_dist)\n        end\n        sum_dists += min_dist\n    end\n    return sum_dists / n_atoms\nendNow we can set up and run the simulation in a similar way to that described in the Molly documentation. The difference is that we wrap the simulation in a loss function. This returns a single value that we want to obtain gradients with respect to, in this case the value of the above function at the end of the simulation. The Zygote.ignore() block allows us to ignore code for the purposes of obtaining gradients; you could add the visualize function there for example.using Zygote\nusing Format\n\ndist_true = 0.5\nscale_σ_to_dist = 2 ^ (1 / 6)\nσtrue = dist_true / scale_σ_to_dist\n\nn_atoms = 50\nn_steps = 250\nmass = 10.0\nbox_size = 3.0\ntimestep = 0.05\ntemp = 3.0\nsimulator = VelocityVerlet()\nneighbour_finder = DistanceNeighbourFinder(ones(n_atoms, n_atoms), 10, 1.5)\nthermostat = FrictionThermostat(0.95)\ngeneral_inters = (LennardJones(true),)\nspecific_inter_lists = ()\ncoords = [box_size .* rand(SVector{3}) for i in 1:n_atoms]\nvelocities = [velocity(mass, temp) for i in 1:n_atoms]\n\nfunction loss(σ)\n    atoms = [Atom(\"\", \"\", 0, \"\", 0.0, mass, σ, 0.2) for i in 1:n_atoms]\n    loggers = Dict(\"coords\" => CoordinateLogger(1))\n\n    s = Simulation(\n        simulator=simulator,\n        atoms=atoms,\n        specific_inter_lists=specific_inter_lists,\n        general_inters=general_inters,\n        coords=coords,\n        velocities=velocities,\n        temperature=temp,\n        box_size=box_size,\n        neighbour_finder=neighbour_finder,\n        thermostat=thermostat,\n        loggers=loggers,\n        timestep=timestep,\n        n_steps=n_steps\n    )\n\n    mms_start = meanminseparation(coords, box_size)\n    final_coords = simulate!(s)\n    mms_end = meanminseparation(final_coords, box_size)\n    loss_val = abs(mms_end - dist_true)\n\n    Zygote.ignore() do\n        printfmt(\"σ {:6.3f}  |  Mean min sep expected {:6.3f}  |  Mean min sep end {:6.3f}  |  Loss {:6.3f}  |  \",\n                    σ, σ * (2 ^ (1 / 6)), mms_end, loss_val)\n    end\n\n    return loss_val\nendWe use a simple friction thermostat that downscales velocities each step to avoid exploding gradients (see discussion below).

The RDF looks as follows, with the purple line corresponding to the desired distance to the closest neighbour. (Image: LJ RDF)At this point it is worth pointing out the API differences to the main package. force! functions are replaced by force functions that return the force vectors, rather than modifying arrays in place. force functions are defined for a few of the current available interactions, and there is an example of a custom function in the neural network example below. A Simulator returns the final coordinates to allow them to be used in the loss function. Hopefully the two APIs will be unified soon."

The jump from single to multiple parameters is important because single parameters can be easily optimised using other approaches, whereas differentiable simulation is well-placed to optimise many parameters simultaneously.We set up three pseudo-atoms and train a network to imitate the Julia logo by moving the bottom two atoms:using Molly\nusing Zygote\nusing Flux\nusing Format\nusing LinearAlgebra\n\ndist_true = 1.0f0\n\nmodel = Chain(\n    Dense(1, 5, relu),\n    Dense(5, 1, tanh)\n)\nps = params(model)\n\nstruct NNBond <: SpecificInteraction\n    i::Int\n    j::Int\nend\n\nfunction Molly.force(coords, b::NNBond, s::Simulation)\n    ab = vector(coords[b.i], coords[b.j], s.box_size)\n    dist = Float32(norm(ab))\n    f = model([dist])[1] * normalize(ab)\n    return [b.i, b.j], [f, -f]\nend\n\nn_steps = 400\nmass = 10.0f0\nbox_size = 5.0f0\ntimestep = 0.02f0\ntemp = 0.0f0\nintegrator = VelocityVerlet()\nneighbour_finder = NoNeighbourFinder()\nthermostat = FrictionThermostat(0.98f0)\ngeneral_inters = (LennardJones(false),) # Ignored due to atom parameters\ncoords = [SVector(2.3f0, 2.07f0), SVector(2.5f0, 2.93f0), SVector(2.7f0, 2.07f0)]\nn_atoms = length(coords)\nn_dims = length(first(coords))\nvelocities = zero(coords)\n\nfunction loss()\n    atoms = [Atom(\"\", \"\", 0, \"\", 0.0f0, mass, 0.0f0, 0.0f0) for i in 1:n_atoms]\n    loggers = Dict(\"coords\" => CoordinateLogger(10, dims=n_dims))\n    specific_inter_lists = ([NNBond(1, 3)],)\n\n    s = Simulation(\n        simulator=integrator,\n        atoms=atoms,\n        specific_inter_lists=specific_inter_lists,\n        general_inters=general_inters,\n        coords=coords,\n        velocities=velocities,\n        temperature=temp,\n        box_size=box_size,\n        neighbour_finder=neighbour_finder,\n        thermostat=thermostat,\n        loggers=loggers,\n        timestep=timestep,\n        n_steps=n_steps\n    )\n\n    final_coords = simulate!(s)\n    dist_end = (norm(vector(final_coords[1], final_coords[2], box_size)) +\n                norm(vector(final_coords[2], final_coords[3], box_size)) +\n                norm(vector(final_coords[3], final_coords[1], box_size))) / 3\n    loss_val = abs(dist_end - dist_true)\n\n    Zygote.ignore() do\n        printfmt(\"Dist end {:6.3f}  |  Loss {:6.3f}\\n\", dist_end, loss_val)\n    end\n\n    return loss_val\nendBefore training the result looks like this: (Image: Logo before)function train()\n    n_epochs = 20\n    opt = ADAM(0.02, (0.9, 0.999))\n\n    for epoch_n in 1:n_epochs\n        coords = [SVector(2.3f0, 2.07f0), SVector(2.5f0, 2.93f0), SVector(2.7f0, 2.07f0)]\n        velocities = zero(coords)\n        printfmt(\"Epoch {:>2}  |  \", epoch_n)\n        Flux.train!(loss, ps, ((),), opt)\n    end\nend\n\ntrain()Epoch  1  |  Dist end  0.675  |  Loss  0.325\nEpoch  2  |  Dist end  0.715  |  Loss  0.285\nEpoch  3  |  Dist end  0.756  |  Loss  0.244\nEpoch  4  |  Dist end  0.793  |  Loss  0.207\nEpoch  5  |  Dist end  0.832  |  Loss  0.168\nEpoch  6  |  Dist end  0.874  |  Loss  0.126\nEpoch  7  |  Dist end  0.918  |  Loss  0.082\nEpoch  8  |  Dist end  0.963  |  Loss  0.037\nEpoch  9  |  Dist end  1.008  |  Loss  0.008\nEpoch 10  |  Dist end  1.036  |  Loss  0.036\nEpoch 11  |  Dist end  1.052  |  Loss  0.052\nEpoch 12  |  Dist end  1.060  |  Loss  0.060\nEpoch 13  |  Dist end  1.060  |  Loss  0.060\nEpoch 14  |  Dist end  1.054  |  Loss  0.054\nEpoch 15  |  Dist end  1.044  |  Loss  0.044\nEpoch 16  |  Dist end  1.029  |  Loss  0.029\nEpoch 17  |  Dist end  1.011  |  Loss  0.011\nEpoch 18  |  Dist end  0.990  |  Loss  0.010\nEpoch 19  |  Dist end  0.977  |  Loss  0.023\nEpoch 20  |  Dist end  0.971  |  Loss  0.029After training it looks much better: (Image: Logo after) You could replace the simple network here with a much more complicated model and it would theoretically be able to train, even if it might prove practically difficult (see discussion below)."

Here are some ideas for loss functions suitable for differentiable molecular simulations:The distance between atoms at the end of the simulation compared to some reference state. This loss is used in the examples given here, is physically reasonable, and has obvious bounds.\nThe distance between atoms throughout the simulation.\nThe radial distribution function of atoms.\nRMSD between atoms and a reference state - this would be suitable for macromolecules.\ndRMSD, the distance between a distance map and a reference distance map.\nThe flexibility of a set of atoms over the simulation.\nSupramolecular geometry, for example assembly of molecules into straight fibres.\nThe correlation of different velocities over the simulation.\nThe energy of the system.\nThe temperature of the system.\nSome measure of phase change or a critical point.\nA combination of the above, for example to obtain a forcefield relevant to both ordered and disordered proteins.Some of these are currently not possible in Molly as the loggers are ignored for gradient purposes, but this will hopefully change when Zygote gets mutation support."

    "text": "Exploding gradients prove a problem when using the velocity Verlet integrator in the NVE ensemble. This is why a thermostat that downscales velocities was used in the above examples - presumably it decays the gradients to the level required for learning. It is likely that the development of suitable simulation strategies and thermostats will be necessary to unlock the potential of differentiable simulation.\nDo you really need a neural network to describe your potential? Think about learning a smaller number of physically-meaningful parameters before you put in a large neural network and expect it to learn. Whilst it is true that neural networks are universal function approximators, it does not follow that you will be able to train one by differentiating through  a long simulation. A 1000-step simulation with a 10-layer network at each step is analogous to training a 10,000 layer network (with shared weights).\nForward mode autodiff holds much promise for differentiable simulation, provided the number of parameters is small, because the memory requirement is constant in the number of simulation steps."
