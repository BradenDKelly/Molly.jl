    Atom(; <keyword arguments>)

An atom and its associated information.
Properties unused in the simulation or in analysis can be left with their
default values.

# Arguments
- `attype::AbstractString=""`: the type of the atom.
- `name::AbstractString=""`: the name of the atom.
- `resnum::Integer=0`: the residue number if the atom is part of a polymer.
- `resname::AbstractString=""`: the residue name if the atom is part of a
    polymer.
- `charge::T=0.0`: the charge of the atom, used for electrostatic interactions.
- `mass::T=0.0`: the mass of the atom.
- `σ::T=0.0`: the Lennard-Jones finite distance at which the inter-particle
    potential is zero.
- `ϵ::T=0.0`: the Lennard-Jones depth of the potential well.

"""
    Simulation(; <keyword arguments>)

The data needed to define and run a molecular simulation.
Properties unused in the simulation or in analysis can be left with their
default values.

# Arguments
- `simulator::Simulator`: the type of simulation to run.
- `atoms::Vector{A}`: the atoms, or atom equivalents, in the simulation. Can be
    of any type.
- `specific_inter_lists::SI=()`: the specific interactions in the simulation,
    i.e. interactions between specific atoms such as bonds or angles. Typically
    a `Tuple`.
- `general_inters::GI=()`: the general interactions in the simulation, i.e.
    interactions between all or most atoms such as electrostatics. Typically a
    `Tuple`.
- `coords::C`: the coordinates of the atoms in the simulation. Typically a
    `Vector` of `SVector`s of any dimension and type `T`, where `T` is an
    `AbstractFloat` type.
- `velocities::C=zero(coords)`: the velocities of the atoms in the simulation,
    which should be the same type as the coordinates. The meaning of the
    velocities depends on the simulator used, e.g. for the `VelocityFreeVerlet`
    simulator they represent the previous step coordinates for the first step.
- `temperature::T=0.0`: the temperature of the simulation.
- `box_size::T`: the size of the cube in which the simulation takes place.
- `neighbour_finder::NeighbourFinder=NoNeighbourFinder()`: the neighbour finder
    used to find close atoms and save on computation.
- `thermostat::Thermostat=NoThermostat()`: the thermostat which applies during
    the simulation.
- `loggers::Dict{String, <:Logger}=Dict()`: the loggers that record properties
    of interest during the simulation.
- `timestep::T=0.0`: the timestep of the simulation.
- `n_steps::Integer=0`: the number of steps in the simulation.
- `n_steps_made::Vector{Int}=[]`: the number of steps already made during the
    simulation. This is a `Vector` to allow the `struct` to be immutable.
